# 🌐 My First Web Project

Hey there! 🙌  
This is a small project I built while learning web development. It's nothing fancy, but it's where I started — and that's what makes it special.

## 🛠 Tech Used

- HTML5 (Structure)
- Git (Version control)
- CSS (Selector, Flex, Grid, Responsive)
- JavaScript (DOM, Event, Arrow functions, Template literals, Destructuring)

## 🌱 What I’m Currently Learning

- Writing clean and semantic HTML
- Managing files and folders in a scalable way
- Using Git for version control and project tracking
- Styling pages with custom CSS and responsive design techniques
- Reviewing JavaScript fundamentals (variables, functions, loops)
- Practicing DOM manipulation and basic user interaction
- Exploring modern JavaScript (ES6+) features like arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring.
- **Learning to use Bootstrap for quick and effective layout and responsive design**
- **Diving into Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and rapid UI development**

## 📝 What I Learned

I’ve been through web development before, but to be honest, I didn’t take it very seriously back then. I was jumping between tutorials, not really knowing what I was doing — and when things got too confusing or frustrating, I gave up.  

It’s been years since I last built anything, so coming back felt a bit rusty at first. But this project helped me reconnect with those foundations — writing HTML, organizing files, and thinking more about structure. Using Git helped me commit with more intention, and adding some CSS gave me a small sense of control over how it all looks. I also learned to use JavaScript to add a basic level of dynamic behavior, making the website more interactive.  

It’s not fancy, but it’s a step forward, and that’s what matters to me right now.

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

- [x] Improve overall styling using **custom CSS**
- [x] Make the layout **responsive** using media queries
- [ ] Apply mobile-first techniques
- [x] Add **basic JavaScript functionality** (like toggling themes or showing/hiding content)  
- [x] Clean up code with modern **ES6 features** (arrow functions, template strings, destructuring)  
- [ ] Dynamically generate HTML content with JavaScript using mock data
- [ ] Use **Bootstrap** for layout and responsive design  
- [ ] Try out **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling  
- [ ] Start learning **React** and create reusable UI components  
- [ ] Build a mini React project (thinking of a Game Recommender!)  
- [ ] Set up a simple backend using **Node.js + Express**  
- [ ] Connect frontend and backend with **REST APIs** and practice **CRUD** operations  
- [ ] Use **Firebase** or **Supabase** for auth and cloud storage  
- [ ] Learn **MongoDB** for NoSQL database handling  
- [ ] Explore **Next.js** for performance optimization and SEO 

## 🤖 AI Assistance Disclaimer

I've tried my best to learn and build this project on my own. But sometimes, I used **AI tools to help me out.**   
For example, AI helped me **get hints and ideas for my code logic** or **point out where issues might be** so I could fix them myself.   
This just helped me learn faster and get past tough parts.
