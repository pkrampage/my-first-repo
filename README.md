# 🌐 My First Web Project

Hey there! 🙌  
This is a small project I built while learning web development. It's nothing fancy, but it's where I started — and that's what makes it special.

## 🛠 Tech Used

- HTML5 (structure)
- Git (version control)

## 🌱 What I’m Currently Learning

- Writing clean and semantic HTML
- Managing files and folders in a scalable way
- Using Git for version control and project tracking
- Styling pages with custom CSS and responsive design techniques
- Reviewing JavaScript fundamentals (variables, functions, loops)
- Practicing DOM manipulation and basic user interaction

## 📝 What I Learned

## 📝 What I Learned

I’ve been through web development before, but to be honest, I didn’t take it very seriously back then.  
I was jumping between tutorials, not really knowing what I was doing — and when things got too confusing or frustrating, I gave up.  
It’s been years since I last built anything, so coming back felt a bit rusty at first.  
But this project helped me reconnect with those foundations — writing HTML, organizing files, and thinking more about structure.  
Using Git helped me commit with more intention, and adding some CSS gave me a small sense of control over how it all looks.  
It’s not fancy, but it’s a step forward, and that’s what matters to me right now.
